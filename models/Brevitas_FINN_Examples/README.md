# Brevitas QONNX Examples

This repo contains pretrained models in the Quantized ONNX format (QONNX) Originally used in the [BNN-PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/BNN-PYNQ) repo
using [Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas).

These pretrained models and training scripts (located in the [Brevitas Repo](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas/tree/master/src/brevitas_examples/bnn_pynq)  are courtesy of 
[Alessandro Pappalardo](https://github.com/volcacius) and [Ussama Zahid](https://github.com/ussamazahid96).

## Models

The "CNV" models are a small VGG/BinaryNet inspired architecture, where the "TFC" models are a "tiny" fully connected network, similar to "SFC"/"LFC" models, with three hidden layers, each with 64 neurons. 
More details about these models can be found in the [FINN: A Framework for Fast, Scalable Binarized Neural Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119) paper. 

NOTE: Accuracy numbers listed here are taken from the Brevitas repo, and are not verified running through QONNX at this time.
